**Task 1: Complete Data Analysis Report**

Title: **Comprehensive Data Analysis Report on Football Player Attributes**

**Executive Summary:**
This data analysis report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of football player attributes and their relationships using a dataset containing information about football players' attributes such as age, overall rating, and positions. The analysis covers three main tasks: country-wise player distribution, the relationship between age and overall rating, and the salary variations among offensive player positions.

**Task 2: Clustering Football Players based on Attributes**

In this task, we aim to cluster football players based on their attributes. This involves using machine learning techniques, such as K-means clustering, to group players with similar skill sets together. This can help identify distinct player profiles and styles of play within the dataset.

**Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis and Questions**

1. **Top 10 Countries with the Most Players:**
   We will prepare a ranked list of the top 10 countries with the most football players in the dataset. This analysis will reveal which countries are producing the highest number of players at this level.

2. **Distribution of Overall Rating vs. Age:**
   We will plot a distribution graph of the overall rating of players against their age. This will help us interpret when players tend to stop improving, as the distribution may show a decline in ratings after a certain age.

3. **Comparison of Offensive Player Salaries:**
   We will analyze the salaries of three offensive player positions: strikers, right-wingers, and left-wingers. By comparing their earnings, we can determine which position tends to get paid the most.

**Overall Objective:**
The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the football player landscape, identifying countries with a strong footballing presence, understanding the age at which players typically plateau in their performance, and determining the relative salaries of different offensive player positions in the football industry. This analysis will aid stakeholders in player recruitment, contract negotiations, and talent development strategies.

The report and findings will empower football clubs, agents, and organizations to make data-driven decisions in the highly competitive world of professional football.
